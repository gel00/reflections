Q - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A - Working on other computer or collaborating with others.

Q - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A - To keep everything under control.

Q - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A - Fork is kind of clone when you copy from gitHub to gitHub and the origin can recognise the forks.
Branch is just a part of the repository.

Q - What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A - You can be up to date without merging your master branch with the origin/master branch.

Q - How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A - I need to share my repository directly, that why I would lost the full controll over it.

Q - When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A - It's a good idea to check new commits with other before merging it to the master branch.
